# JCHS FBLA Website - Frontend

# Description
Frontend for the JCHS FBLA Website from August of 2024. Experimental: Use at your own risk.

# Status
The website's content is outdated, so use the forms/index.astro page and move that to the current implementation. Due to the static nature of the website, it can be moved to github pages like the old website. <br/> 
Completed Forms: <br/>
- [x] Membership Form

In Progress Forms: <br/>

- [ ] RLC Form

Future Forms: <br/>

# Astro Basics
## ðŸš€ Project Structure
Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`             | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`             | Starts local dev server at `localhost:4321`      |
| `npm run build`           | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`         | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`       | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
| `npm run astro -- --help` | Get help using the Astro CLI                     |
